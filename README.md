- 👋 Hi, I’m Anna Koroleva, a computational linguist/data scientist holding a PhD in Natural Language Processing.
- 👀 I’m interested in:
     - Biomedical NLP: I have worked in BioNLP for several years in both industry and academia. My PhD project was devoted to detecting “spin” - unjustified positive presentation of clinical trial results - in biomedical articles. I am currently working on a new and improved version of the code that can be found here: https://github.com/aakorolyova/DeSpin-2.0
     - Conversational AI: as a linguist in tech, I'm fascinated by the task of "teaching the machine to speak" :). On a serious note, I find it amazing how Conversational AI combines a lot of aspects of NLP and software development to create virtual assistants capable of solving so many various tasks. I participated in two AI challenges devoted to developing chatbots (read a blog about it at https://omdena.com/blog/how-to-build-a-chatbot-using-rasa/)
     - AI for Good: I’m an active member of Omdena AI for Good community (https://omdena.com). I participated in 3 challenges as a Machine Learning Engineer and in 1 challenge as the Product Owner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things! My first degree is in linguistics, we had little programming at the university, so I'm constantly working on improving my computer science skills such as data structures and algorithms. Machine learning / deep learning is another big learning track for me (the more I learn, the more there is to learn).
